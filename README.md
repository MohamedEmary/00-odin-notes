# Odin Notes

Here I add some of the notes I take throughout The Odin Project Curriculum.

<!-- To Do -->
<!-- 1. Add a list of lessons and their content and links that lead to each lesson -->
<!-- 2. Better organize foundations directory by making .md files in a separate directory and .pdf files in another one -->
