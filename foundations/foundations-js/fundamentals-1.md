***First of all read the highlighted notes from the [JavaScript.info](https://JavaScript.info) book on kindle.***

## Difference between `let`, `var`, and `const`

| Keyword | Scope | Can be reassigned | Can be redeclared | Hoisted | Temporal Dead Zone | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| -- | -- | --- | --- | -- | --- | ---- | ------ |
| `var`   | Function | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Can be useful for hoisting | Can lead to unexpected behavior due to hoisting and function scope |
| `let`   | Block | Yes | No | No | Yes | Block scoping can prevent variable leakage | Cannot be hoisted, which can lead to reference errors |
| `const` | Block | No | No | No | Yes | Prevents accidental reassignment | Cannot be reassigned, which can be inconvenient in some cases |

## Some JavaScript Notes

- `"use strict";` prevents the use of undeclared variables. like `x = 3.14;` which will throw an error. because it wasn't declared first. So it has to be `let x = 3.14;`

- Constant that are known perior to execution are named in UPPERCASE. like `const PI = 3.14;` while constants that are calculated at run time are named in lowercase. like `const area = PI * radius * radius;`

- Declaration with an assignment (such as let b = 7 * a) returns undefined and so you cannot declare and assign a value to a variable and read its value in the same line.

- Notice the difference between pre-increment and post-increment:

```javascript
      let x = 5;
      console.log(x++); //5 because x++ is post increment
      console.log(x); //6 now x is already incremented
      console.log(++x); //7 because ++x is pre increment
```

- In JavaScript, you can do this `m = Math;` then use `m.sqrt(2)`. What you see is that we assigned the `Math` object to the variable `m`. So we can use it as a shortcut so we just type `m` instead of `Math`.

- Some info related to numbers representation:
  - JavaScript has only one type of number. Unlike many other programming languages, JavaScript does not define different types of numbers, like integers, short, long, floating-point etc. JavaScript Numbers are *Always 64-bit* Floating Point (Double Precision). It uses the international IEEE 754 standard 1 bit for the sign, 11 bits for the exponent, and 52 bits for the mantissa.

  - Floating point arithmetic is not always 100% accurate. Test this `let x = 0.2 + 0.1;` If you print `x` it will give you `0.30000000000000004`. This is because of IEEE 754 standard for storing and doing calculations on floating point numbers. We can also solve the problem if we multiply and divide: `let x = (0.2 * 10 + 0.1 * 10) / 10;`

- If you add a number and a string, the result will be a string concatenation:

## Some notes on numbers

**A common mistake is to expect this result to be 30:**

```javascript
  let x = 10;
  let y = 20;
  let z = "The result is: " + x + y;
```

**A common mistake is to expect this result to be 102030:**

```javascript
let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let z = "30";
let result = x + y + z;
```

**JavaScript will try to convert strings to numbers in all numeric operations:**

```javascript
let x = "100";
let y = "10";
let z = x / y;
```

**This is a NaN: `let x = 100 / "Apple";`**

**Result here will be a concatenation like "NaN5":**

```javascript
let x = NaN;
let y = "5";
let z = x + y;
```

**NaN is a number: `typeof NaN` returns `number`.**

**Never write a number with a leading zero (like 07). Some JavaScript versions interpret numbers as octal if they are written with a leading zero.**

**The `toString()` method can output numbers from base 2 to 36:**

**Decimal 32 different representations:**

Code will be like: `MyNumber.toString(base);`

| Base | Base Name | Result | Conversion |
| --- | --- | --- | ---------- |
| 36   | Hexatrigesimal   | w     | $w = 32$   |
| 32   | Duotrigesimal   |  10    | $1 \times 32 + 0 \times 1 = 32$ |
| 16   | Hexadecimal   | 20     | $2 \times 16 + 0 \times 1 = 32$ |
| 12   | Duodecimal   | 28     | $2 \times 12 + 8 \times 1 = 32$ |
| 10   | Decimal   | 32     | $3 \times 10 + 2 \times 1 = 32$ |
| 8    | Octal    | 40     | $4 \times 8 + 0 \times 1 = 32$ |
| 2    | Binary    | 100000     | $1 \times 32 + 0 \times 16 + 0 \times 8 + 0 \times 4 + 0 \times 2 + 0 \times 1 = 32$ |

**Numbers can be defined as objects with the keyword new: `let y = new Number(123);`. However, avoid `new` keyword. It complicates the code, slows down execution, and produce unexpected results.**

**Here the result is 743, not 77, because myNumber is actually defined as a string.**

```javascript
let myNumber = "74";
myNumber += 3;
typeof myNumber; // string not number
```

The `+` operator

```javascript
// No effect on numbers
let x = 1;
alert( +x ); // 1

let y = -2;
alert( +y ); // -2

// Converts non-numbers
alert( +true ); // 1
alert( +"" );   // 0```
```

## Operators in JS

Comparison between `==` and `===` operators in JS

| Operator | Name | Description | Example |
| -- | --- | -------- | -------- |
| `==` | Equality | Test whether the values are the same but not whether the values' datatypes are the same | `5 == "5"` returns `true` because JavaScript converts the string `"5"` to the number `5` before making the comparison. |
| `===` | Strict Equality | Test the equality of both the values and their datatypes | `5 === "5"` returns `false` because the operands are of different types. |

***The strict versions tend to result in fewer errors, so we recommend you use them.***

**Comparing two JavaScript objects always returns false.**

```javascript
x = new Number(500);
y = new Number(500);
console.log(x == y); // flase
console.log(x === y); // flase
```

**The comma operator allows us to evaluate several expressions, dividing them with a comma ,. Each of them is evaluated but only the result of the last one is returned.**

```javascript
let a = (1 + 2, 3 + 4);
alert( a ); // 7 (the result of 3 + 4)
```

Please note that the comma operator has very low precedence, lower than =, so parentheses are important in the example above.

Without them: a = 1 + 2, 3 + 4 evaluates + first, summing the numbers into a = 3, 7, then the assignment operator = assigns a = 3, and the rest is ignored. Itâ€™s like (a = 1 + 2), 3 + 4.
