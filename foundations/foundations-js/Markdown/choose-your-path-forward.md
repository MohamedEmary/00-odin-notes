# What you should have learned

After finishing foundations section of The Odin Project you should be able to:

1. Typing commands into your computer’s command line
2. Understand what happens when you enter a web address into your browser and it returns a functioning page
3. Create a basic web page and make it do some basic things with JavaScript
4. Understand of how all this fits together in your future as a builder of web applications.

# The aim of The Odin Project

The aim of finishing The Odin Project is to be able to build a full-featured and scalable web application.

# Learning Programming

Learning how to program is much more than just learning a language. It’s:

1. learning how to research and solve difficult problems
2. building an engineering mindset
3. working on complex problems and codebases
4. communicating effectively with other developers

Luckily, all these skills are transferrable to other languages and domains of software and because most languages are similar in concept and structure, **moving into a different language will be much easier** than learning your first.

# Choose your path forward

You can choose between two paths:

> ***One important thing is to not switch halfway though; this will only set you back.***

1. Ruby with Ruby on Rails
2. JavaScript with Node/Express
