# What is Node.js

Installation Commands for NVM and Node.js are in [**Lesson Page**](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-installing-node-js)

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript outside of your web browser.

**`nvm`: Node Version Manager**

**`npm`: Node Package Manager**

Node provides an interactive console which lets you run and edit your javascript code right in your terminal

`nvm` only works in Linux and Mac OS but there is an alternative for Windows see [this](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).
