- The text argues that code is the primary documentation of a software system, as it is the most detailed and precise.
- The text clarifies that code is not the only documentation, but it should be supplemented by other forms when needed.
- The text cites Jack Reeves’s essay “What is Software Design?” as a source of inspiration for this principle.
- The text emphasizes the importance of making code clear and readable, as it is not inherently clear.
- The text acknowledges that most code bases are not very good documentation, but it rejects the fallacy that they cannot be improved.
- The text asserts that it is possible to write clear code, and that most code bases can be made much more clear.
- The text suggests that one reason for poor code quality is the lack of seriousness in treating code as documentation.
- The text implies that programmers should put more effort and intention into writing code that communicates well.

- The article explains how to write **chainable** or **cascading** methods in JavaScript, which allow calling multiple methods on an object in one line of code.
- The article provides examples of chainable methods in jQuery and native JavaScript methods, such as `array.sort().reverse().join()`¹.
- The article shows how to create a custom object constructor function that can be used to instantiate new objects with chainable methods.
- The article demonstrates how to add chainable methods to the custom object's prototype, using the `this` keyword to refer to the current object and return it at the end of each method.
- The article also explains how to use **getters** and **setters** to access and modify the properties of the custom object without breaking the chain.
- The article gives an example of a chainable method that accepts a callback function as an argument and executes it on the current object.
- The article discusses the benefits of using chainable methods, such as improved readability, expressiveness, and performance.
- The article also mentions some drawbacks of using chainable methods, such as increased complexity, potential errors, and difficulty in debugging.
- The article suggests some best practices for writing chainable methods, such as using descriptive names, avoiding side effects, and documenting the code.
- The article concludes by encouraging the reader to experiment with chainable methods and share their feedback.
