# [Handling text â€” strings in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Strings#the_power_of_words)

**Template literal** is a string in which we use backtick characters **(`)**, instead of using single or double quote marks **(' or ")**

ex:

```{.js .numberLines}
const one = "Hello, ";
const two = "how are you?";
const joined = `${one}${two}`;
console.log(joined); // "Hello, how are you?"
```

---

Every number has a method called `toString()` that converts it to the equivalent string.

The `Number()` function converts anything passed to it into a number.

---

Template literals respect the line breaks (You can also just use `\n` if you want) in the source code, so you can write strings that span multiple lines like this:

```{.js .numberLines}
const output = `I like the song.
I gave it a score of 90%.`;
console.log(output);

/*
The output will be:
I like the song.
I gave it a score of 90%.
*/
```

# [JavaScript String Methods](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_methods.asp)

JS is just like python in case of indexing the last index is not included.

All string methods return a new string. They don't modify the original string.

Strings are immutable: Strings cannot be changed, only replaced.

---

Comparison `substr()`, `substring()`, and `slice()`:

| Method | Parameters | Negative Index |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------ |
| `substr()` | `start`, `length` **not end** | Allowed |
|||
| `substring()` | `start`, `end` | Treated as zero |
|||
| `slice()` | `start`, `end` | Allowed |

In the 3 functions if you omit the `end` parameter it will slice out the rest of the string.

---

`replace()` function notes:

- The `replace()` method replaces only the first match
- If you want to replace all matches, **use a regular expression** with the `/g` flag set, or use the `replaceAll()` method.
- `replace()` method is case sensitive, and to replace case insensitive, use a regular expression with an `/i` flag (***i***nsensitive):

> Important note related to regular expressions: **regular expressions are written without quotes.**

The regex begins and ends with `/` and the `g` flag means global, i.e. replace all occurrences, `i` flag means case insensitive.

Example: `console.log(my_str.replace(/this/gi, "that"));`

If you use regex with `replaceAll()` method you have to use the `g` flag, otherwise a TypeError is thrown

---

Padding methods `padStart()` and `padEnd()` take **length** and character as parameters: `string.padStart(length, character)`

Strings can be indexed using `[ ]` or `charAt()` If no character is found, [ ] returns undefined, while `charAt()` returns an empty string

**strings in JS are immutable**, so you can't change a character in a string by doing something like `my_str[0] = "A";` you will not get an error, but the string will not change.

```{.js .numberLines}
text.split(",")    // Split on commas
text.split(" ")    // Split on spaces
text.split("|")    // Split on pipe
text.split("")    // Split on individual characters
```

# [JavaScript String Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_string.asp)

**JavaScript, methods and properties are also available to strings, because JavaScript treats strings as objects**

look at String HTML Wrapper Methods in the page

| Name | Description |
| ------- | -------------------- |
| `indexOf()` | Returns the index (position) of the first occurrence of a value in a string |
||
|`repeat()` | Returns a new string with a number of copies of a string |

# [String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)

**String primitives** and **string objects** share many behaviors, but have other important differences

The `eval(string_primitive)` function:

```{.js .numberLines}
const s1 = "2 + 2"; // creates a string primitive
const s2 = new String("2 + 2"); // creates a String object
console.log(eval(s1)); // returns the number 4
console.log(eval(s2)); // returns the string "2 + 2"
```

A String object can always be converted to its primitive counterpart with the `valueOf()` method.

```{.js .numberLines}
console.log(eval(s2.valueOf())); // returns the number 4
```

**[String coercion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#string_coercion)**

Many built-in operations that expect strings first coerce their arguments to strings (which is largely why String objects behave similarly to string primitives). The operation can be summarized as follows:

- Strings are returned as-is.
- `undefined` turns into `"undefined"`.
- `null` turns into `"null"`.
- `true` turns into `"true"`; `false` turns into `"false"`.
- Numbers are converted with the same algorithm as `toString(10)`.
- BigInts are converted with the same algorithm as `toString(10)`.
- Symbols throw a TypeError.
- Objects are first converted to a primitive by calling its `[@@toPrimitive]()` (with `"string"` as hint), `toString()`, and `valueOf()` methods, in that order. The resulting primitive is then converted to a string.

**There are several ways to achieve nearly the same effect in JavaScript.**

- Template literal: ``${x}``` does exactly the string coercion steps explained above for the embedded expression.
- The `String()` function: `String(x)` uses the same algorithm to convert `x`, except that Symbols don't throw a `TypeError`, but return `"Symbol(description)"`, where `description` is the description of the Symbol.
- Using the `+` operator: `"" + x` coerces its operand to a primitive instead of a string, and, for some objects, has entirely different behaviors from normal string coercion. See its reference page for more details.

# [Comparisons](https://javascript.info/comparison)

| Value | Type | Numeric Conversion | Equality Check | Strict Equality Check | Comparison |
| -- | -- | --- | ------ | ----- | --- |
| `null` | `null` | `0` | `null`, `undefined` only return `true`, other values are `false` | only return `true`, other values are `false` | `<, <=, >, >= 0` |
| | | |
| `undefined` | `undefined` | `NaN` | | `undefined` only return `true`, other values are `false` | Always `false` |

# [Conditionals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals)

A common pattern you'll come across again and again. Any value that is not `false`, `undefined`, `null`, `0`, `NaN`, or an empty string (`''`) actually returns `true` when tested as a conditional statement, therefore you can use a variable name on its own to test whether it is `true`, or even that it exists (that is, it is not undefined.)

So for example:

```{.js .numberLines}
let cheese = "Cheddar";

if (cheese) {
  console.log("Yay! Cheese available for making cheese on toast.");
} else {
  console.log("No cheese on toast for you today.");
}
```

As you see from the above code, `cheese` is used as a conditional statement and it returns `true` because it is neither `false`, `undefined`, `null`, `0`, `NaN`, or an empty string (`''`).

See the two examples at the end of the article.
