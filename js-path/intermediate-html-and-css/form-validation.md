- ***First read all code snippets in [lesson page.](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-form-validation)***

- Form validation is also covered in this [video](https://youtu.be/jlD4wL7vxc4) in the [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLknwEmKsW8OuN04Odt2sJqt4aAnkp-iYA) we talked about in the last lesson.

# Assignment Articles I Didn't Read

**I may return to these articles later.**

- Read and follow along to [MDN’s Client-Side Form Validation Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation)
  - Skip the section on “Validating forms using JavaScript”. This will be covered in a future lesson.

- Go through SitePoint’s [Complete Guide to HTML Forms and Constraint Validation Guide](https://www.sitepoint.com/html-forms-constraint-validation-complete-guide/). You can skip the section on “JavaScript and the Constraint Validation API” and “Creating a Custom Form Validator”.

- Read Silo Creativo’s article [Improving UX in forms](https://www.silocreativo.com/en/css-rescue-improving-ux-forms/).

# Some notes

We can target form controls that have passed or failed validations using the `:valid` and `:invalid` pseudo-classes.
